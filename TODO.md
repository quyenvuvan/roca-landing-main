# TODO: Fix Header Display on Small Screens

- [x] Update Header.tsx: Change mobile menu positioning to top-full, add z-50, make logo text responsive (text-lg md:text-xl), add relative to header
- [x] Test the changes by running the app and checking responsiveness on different screen widths
- [x] Update _home.tsx: Make hero image smaller on mobile with object-contain to show whole image without cropping
