# TODO: Make Image Touch Header

- [x] Update src/app/_home.tsx: Add absolute positioning to #brand-intro section (top: 0, left: 0, w-screen, h-screen, z-index: -1) to position image behind header
- [x] Ensure figure inside section covers full viewport and image is visible behind header
- [x] Verify layout: Image should touch/behind header without affecting functionality (dev server running at http://localhost:3001)
